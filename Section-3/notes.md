 Default margins
 ===============

 The body tad has a default margin (8), as well as many other tags have default margins. h1, etc..

 ## Margin collapsing

css-margin-collapsing.pdf

> When there are elements next to another when both have specified a (top/bottom) margin, the margins are combined. The larger margin 'wins'.

## Content Sizing

### `box-sizing: content-box;`
Specified `size` will target the content area of the element. Padding and Border are added to the total size of the element.

### `box-sizing: border-box`

Specified `size` includes Padding and Border.

Neither of the options *never* include the Margin.
